I had to cut some really tall and thick grass and not once did the mower bog down. The size of the mower is convenient for fitting it in the back of my Chevy Colorado pickup truck. Of course, I would love to ride one of the big Enduro tractors, but I do have some tight spots to drive around, so the CC 30 is perfect! Smooth running and powerful. And, with the engine in the rear, I don't have exhaust blowing in my face!”",

	"faqs": [
		{
			"question": "Can you use a riding mower on a small yard?",
			"answer": "Riding mowers are suitable for small yards, particularly those that are one-half acre in size or larger. A small riding lawn mower can significantly speed up the mowing process. This increased cutting width allows for faster coverage and improved productivity, making the maintenance of your small yard more manageable."
		},

		{
			"question": "What type of mower is recommended for a half acre?",
			"answer": "When it comes to a half-acre lawn, both small riding lawn mowers and <a href=\"https://www.cubcadet.com/en_US/walk-behind-mowers/self-propelled-mowers\">self-propelled walk-behind mowers</a> are viable options. Self-propelled mowers feature front or rear-powered wheels that aide in maneuvering around the yard and alleviate some of the physical effort required. They offer a convenient solution for maintaining a half-acre lawn efficiently. On the other hand, if you prefer a seated position and want to cover the area more quickly, a small riding lawn mower can also be a suitable choice. It provides comfort and convenience while navigating the yard. Cub Cadet offers two small riding lawn mowers, the Cub Cadet <a href=\"https://www.cubcadet.com/en_US/small-riding-lawn-mower-cc-30-h/13AC21JDA10.html\">CC30H</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.cubcadet.com/en_US/electric-riding-mowers/cc30e/33BA27JDB10.html\">CC30E</a>."
		},
		{
			"question": "Is a riding mower worth it for a half acre?",
			"answer": "When it comes to half-acre lawns, investing in a riding mower can be a worthwhile choice. A riding mower offers several advantages for yards of this size, including enhanced efficiency and reduced cutting time compared to a walk-behind mower. By opting for a riding mower with a 30 deck, you can significantly speed up the mowing process and cover more ground with each pass compared to a walk-behind mower. This increased cutting width allows for faster coverage and improved productivity, making the maintenance of your half-acre lawn more manageable. Cub Cadet offers two riding lawn mowers with a 30 in deck, the Cub Cadet <a href=\"https://www.cubcadet.com/en_US/small-riding-lawn-mower-cc-30-h/13AC21JDA10.html\">CC30H</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.cubcadet.com/en_US/electric-riding-mowers/cc30e/33BA27JDB10.html\">CC30E</a>. Both models are equipped with a hitch that offers light towing capabilities and a mulch plug that prevents grass from escaping the machine, enabling it to be finely chopped into smaller pieces for use as lawn fertilizer."
		},
		{
			"question": "What are the benefits of a small riding lawn mower?",
			"answer": "Small riding lawn mowers offer several benefits. A compact design makes them highly maneuverable, allowing easy navigation around tight corners and through small gates. Benefits of the Cub Cadet CC30H and the CC30E specifically include:<ul><li>Ability to mow through a 36” gate doorway.</li><li>The compact size allows for easy storage, fitting in the space of two garbage cans.</li><li>Rear engine/battery location allows for a better line of sight with an unobstructed view while mowing vs. a lawn tractor.</li></ul>"
		},
		{
			"question": "What is the smallest riding lawn mower?",
			"answer": "The smallest riding lawn mowers available in the Cub Cadet® lineup are the <a href=\"https://www.cubcadet.com/en_US/small-riding-lawn-mower-cc-30-h/13AC21JDA10.html\">CC30H</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cubcadet.com/en_US/electric-riding-mowers/cc30e/33BA27JDB10.html\">CC30E</a> models. These small riding lawn mowers feature a compact design and come equipped with a 30-in. cutting deck. These mowers maintain excellent maneuverability and are capable of efficiently navigating tight spaces. "
