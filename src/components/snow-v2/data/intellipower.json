    {
      "intellipower": [
        {
          "question": "What is IntelliPower?",
          "answer": "This engine technology electronically controls engine speed to create consistent mowing performance for users that might be challenged to cut through thick, wet heavy grass by delivering more power from the engine to the blades resulting in a Signature Cut™ every time."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does IntelliPower work?",
          "answer": "IntelliPower technology has various electronic inputs that measure engine speed and temperature, which allows an onboard computer to digitally control the throttle position to maintain engine speed without the operator noticing. This prevents the engine from bogging down in challenging conditions, improving performance in heavy, wet grass, while mulching, bagging, or side discharging."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does IntelliPower benefit me?",
          "answer": "A decrease in engine speed means a decrease in blade speed, which leads to an uneven cut, or the unit stalling out. When you engage IntelliPower, you are digitally maintaining your engine speed, giving you up to 20% more available power* that you can feel and hear."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I know if my unit has electronic governing?",
          "answer": "Just look for IntelliPower, which is exclusive to Cub Cadet and featured on our snow blowers and walk behind/ride-on mowers."
        },
        {
          "question": "Where is the throttle cable?",
          "answer": "An engine with IntelliPower is controlled with an electronic speed selector that allows the user to pick any speed that they require. Say goodbye to physical choke and throttle cables."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does the IntelliPower feature require any maintenance?",
          "answer": "No. The IntelliPower feature is controlled by an onboard computer that requires no additional maintenance throughout the life of the engine. In fact, this feature requires less components than a standard mechanical governed engine."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do Cub Cadet IntelliPower engines accept E85?",
          "answer": "No. E85 is a blend of gasoline containing mostly ethanol (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline). Operating the engine with E15 or E85 fuel may result in damage to your engine’s carburetor."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do Cub Cadet IntelliPower engines accept diesel fuel?",
          "answer": "No. Use automotive gasoline (unleaded or low leaded to minimize combustion chamber deposits) with a minimum of 87 octane."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "efi": [
        {
          "question": "What is EFI?",
          "answer": "Electronic fuel injection (EFI) is a high-pressure fuel management system. Just like on today’s cars, EFI uses an onboard computer, injector nozzle and multiple sensors to reliably deliver exactly the right amount of fuel to get the most performance and efficiency out of your engine. Cub EFI is an advanced electronically controlled system that uses real-time feedback to sense usage conditions an instantly optimize combustion to give you smooth running and exceptional starting you can count on, no matter what."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does EFI work?",
          "answer": "EFI, or any fuel injection system, utilizes a special high-pressure fuel deliver nozzle to inject an ultra-fine mist of fuel into the engine. An electronic control unit uses sensors around the engine to deliver the precise amount of fuel the engine needs, improving response, efficiency and starting. Cub EFI adjusts the fuel metering on-the-fly to compensate for variations in load, speed, fuel, temp and pressure to always feed your engine the perfect charge that it needs for maximum performance at any task."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do EFI engines require less maintenance?",
          "answer": "Yes. EFI systems produce cleaner combustion, resulting in a cleaner engine clean engines can go longer between regular oil changes and required major maintenance. We do still recommend a fuel stabilizer for long-term storage to make sure the fuel in the tank stays fresh so you'll be ready to mow with a push of a button next spring."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does EFI benefit me?",
          "answer": "EFI technology provides quicker startup, making both hot and cold restarts easier so your equipment will start when you need it most. It also creates a more powerful engine, easier storage, and requires less maintenance."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are EFI engines more resistant to fuel system corrosion and “ethanol damage” so often seen today?",
          "answer": "Yes. The fuel system is ethanol-resistant and compatible with gasoline fuels up to E15 (15% ethanol) blends. Unlike carburetors, the EFI system doesn't rely on mechanical components and easy -to-clog jets. Critical EFI components are totally sealed, making the entire system more tolerant to today's common automotive gasoline blends."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does EFI help with fuel efficiency?",
          "answer": "Yes. EFI uses up to 25% less fuel versus standard carbureted engines, which means fewer emissions and fewer fill-ups."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does Cub Cadet EFI accept E85?",
          "answer": "No. E85 is a blend of gasoline containing mostly ethanol (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline). Operating the engine with E15 or E85 fuel may result in damage to your engine’s carburetor."
        },
